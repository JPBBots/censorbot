  <div id="perks">
    <div>
      <h3>Resend</h3>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Multi-Line</h3>
      <p>This combines a line of messages from the same user to create one full message, this removes the ability to bypass the bot using multiple messages.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Font Recognition</h3>
      <p>Heavily maintained and accurate font recognition, removing a users ability to bypass curses using character lookalikes.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Ignore Channels</h3>
      <p>Gives you the ability to set a list of channels to completely ignore curses from, rather than requiring you to set them to NSFW.</p>
    </div>
