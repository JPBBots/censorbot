    <h2>Premium Server Perks</h2>
    <p>All settings marked with a <Star> can be changed in your server's dashboard. These perks are:</p>  
  </center>
  <div id="perks">
    <div>
      <h3>Resend</h3>
      <p>Whenever someone curses, it send the users message again with curse words blocked out using spoilers, hashtags, or stars. Creating the illusion of a message that has the curse removed.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Multi-Line</h3>
      <p>This combines a line of messages from the same user to create one full message, this removes the ability to bypass the bot using multiple messages.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Anti-NSFW Images</h3>
      <p>Discords built in anti-nsfw images leaves some to be desired, but we've added a custom AI filter which runs it through another check that's more stringent!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Remove Roles</h3>
      <p>In a server with complicated role hierarchy, it can be nice for when a user is muted to remove all of their roles, this is what it does! And gives them back once they've been unmuted.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Toxicity Filter</h3>
      <p>Using advanced AI, we scan every message for anything remotely toxic, this can be very strict but great for only-positive communities.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</h3>
      <p>Using advanced AI, the bot will scan every image sent for text, and then match that up against the filter (including server filter)! Removing another way users can bypass the filter.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Increased Maximums</h3>
      <p>A list of increases:
        <ul>
          <li>Filter: Maximum words from 150 to 1500</li>
          <li>Uncensor List: Maximum words from 150 to 1500</li>
          <li>Pop Message: Delete after time from 120 seconds to 600</li>
          <li>Pop message: Max content size from 200 characters to 1000</li>
          <li>Ignored Channels: Max amount from 5 to infinite</li>
          <li>Ignoreed Roles: Max amount from 4 to infinite</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Less noteable:</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>DM Command Responses: Makes responses to commands respond in the invokers DM's rather than in the same channel.</li>
          <li>DM Popup Messages: sends the popup message to a users DMs rather than in the chat.</li>
          <li>Long lasting HelpME codes, allowing staff to diagnose your problem over the span of months.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
