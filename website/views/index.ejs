            <h2>Customization</h2>
            <p>
              We have an array of commands to allow you and your staff to customize how you want your server to <br /> 
					  	be. We allow you to add words to the filter and remove words from the filter for specifically <br /> 
					  	your server. We even have features to allow a certain role to be uncensored, and allow certain <br /> 
					  	channels to be uncensored.
