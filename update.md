**Censor Bot v13** :censorbot: 

First off we have an amazing new dashboard completely thanks to @Synqat#7777 for designing it! It's a lot more functional and allows for much more expandability
Speaking of expandability, with our brand new space, here's a bunch of new features!

**Phrase Filter**, Match Exact was a terrible temporary solution, so now there's a dedicated setting. The phrase filter disregards the resolution step, which means you can use any characters, including spaces

**Word Filter**, similar to phrase filter, it disregards the resolution, but it also has a special quirk, that it only matches specific words, which means e.g "hello" could be censored while "a__hello__b" wouldn't be even though the word is in it

**Brand new exception management**
  There are still super easy-to-use, ignored roles and ignored channels settings. But now there's a brand new feature, **advanced** exceptions, which allow you to take into account roles and channels, and ignore specific things, like the server filter, pre-built filter, invite filter, punishments, response message, anti-hoist

**Punishments**
  - *Multiple Punishments* you can now add multiple tiers of punishments, allowing you to have different punishments per amount of warnings
  - *Timeouts* punishments can now timeout users, removing the need to enforce a muted role. Give roles is still an option, however the option to remove roles is no longer available
  - A new setting to specify when a user should be punished from the censor type list

**Nicknames**
  - *Nickname Replacement*: You can now customize what name to set nicknames to when the user has an inappropriate username
  - *Remove Nickname*: You can now toggle on and off whether or not to reset a users nickname if it's inappropriate or just set it to the nickname replacement

**New Censor Methods**
  - *Thread Names*: You now have the option to censor thread names, which is useful if anyone can create a thread. This is turned off by default
  - :premium: *User Avatars*: Kick anyone who joins your server with an inappropriate profile picture. (Planned server profile censoring, but not yet possible)

**New extras**
  - *Anti-Phishing*: Check every message for a list of links deemed to be phishing/scam sites
  - *Attachment Censoring*: Check every attachment for an inappropriate name or rendered content (text)

*Note: Popup -> Response*

:premium: Brand new premium flow which links to your account email / SSO without having to use a linking page

**New pages**
  - Status page has made a comeback! <https://censor.bot/status>
  - A staff page, with the removal of the credits command <https://jpbbots.org/staff>

**Full transition to slash commands**
All commands are now / commands, meaning you hit / to run the command. Message commands will return an error saying that you must transfer

Speaking of;
**New commands**
  - /warnings : allows the management (clearing, setting, and adding) of warnings to contribute to punishments
  - /snipe : Snipes the most previously Censor Bot deleted message in the specified channel
  - /scan :premium: : Scans the last 100 messages for curses and removes them
  - /purgeresend :premium: : Removes all resends in the last 30 minutes from a specific user

As you can see, this update, took a very very long time. Simply because of how ambitious the ideas were. The more room that was added, the more ideas just came flooding. And I'm super happy with the amount of customization and just simply the amount of options that were added. This update has been ongoing for 8 months, and I'm so happy that we finally have some real tangible results for you guys. I hope you enjoyed, as always, :heart: - Berry
